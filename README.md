Keep your fleet state in-memory for fast access and on top of it make calculations using Uber's H3.

## Usage
Once you have it running you can infleet, defleet, update positions, get h3 index for vehicles

```elixir
alias Hive.Vehicle

# Infleet new vehicles
{:ok, _pid} = Hive.infleet("autonomous-vehicle-id")
{:ok, _pid} = Hive.infleet(%Vehicle{id: "autonomous-vehicle-id"})
{:ok, _pid} = Hive.infleet("normal-vehicle-id")
{:ok, _pid} = Hive.infleet(%Vehicle{id: "normal-vehicle-id"})

# Defleet vehicles
{:ok, _pid} = Hive.defleet("normal-vehicle-id")
{:ok, _pid} = Hive.defleet(%Vehicle{id: "normal-vehicle-id"})
```

## Installation

This library can be installed by adding `hive` to the list of dependencies in
your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:hive, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```
